# DSCI-210-Portfolio

# Summer 2024
During the past summer, me and 8 of the other Data Science students were paid to analyze and interpret data about the core curriculum at Xavier University. We worked on the dataset for 4 weeks and at the end we presented our findings to our employers. Everyone contributed something throughout the 4 weeks, but my biggest role was putting the final quarto document together. I also helped with finding what requirements each core class fufilled. This was very helpful when we went to classify classes later in the internship. The quarto document that is in this Portfolio is the one that I did and that we submitted. The presentation we gave made a lasting impression and our findings may produce some changes to the CORE curriculum at Xavier soon.

# Melissa Powers Campaign
Throughout the fall semester we had an oppertunity to work on a political campaign to recieve real-world Data Science experience. The code I have in this portfolio is a Quorto created by Dr. Gerberry and edited by me. I made a map of the Deters vs Ruckert election in Hamilton county in 2020. Even though it was for a presentation, It was valuable for me to use an brand new dataset and produce a map I never thought I could produce.
